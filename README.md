# Flipkart Customer Sentimental Analysis - Python

## Overview
This repository contains a sentiment analysis project performed on customer reviews scraped from Flipkart's website. The analysis aims to identify patterns and sentiments in customer feedback, leveraging Python for data processing and visualization.

## Project Objective
As a Data Analyst at Flipkart, you have been tasked with gauging customer sentiment towards the iPhone 15 128GB model. The primary goal of this project is to analyze public perception and evaluate customer reactions by performing sentiment analysis on product reviews posted by users. By extracting and processing customer reviews, you will derive insights about the overall sentiment (positive or negative) surrounding the product, which can be useful for decision-making, improving customer experience, and identifying key areas for product improvement.

## Dataset
The dataset (`flipkart_data.csv`) contains the following necessary columns:
- `review_text`: The review provided by the customer.
- `rating`: The rating given by the customer (1-5).

## Key Python Code

### Data Preprocessing
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('datasets/flipkart_data.csv')

# Overview of the dataset
print(data.head())
print(data.info())

# Checking for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Basic statistics
print(data.describe())
```

### Data Visualization
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Visualize rating distribution
sns.countplot(data['rating'], palette='viridis')
plt.title('Rating Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Ratings')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

## Results
- **EDA Findings**: Distributions of customer ratings and review statistics were visualized.

## Future Work
- Enhance text preprocessing with advanced techniques.
- Explore customer feedback trends over time.
